## Overview

testdat is designed to ease data validation, particularly for complex
data processing, inspired by software unit testing. testdat extends the
strong and flexible unit testing framework already provided by
[testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) with a family of functions and
reporting tools focused on checking of data frames.

Features include:

-   A fully fledged test framework so you can spend more time specifying
    tests and less time running them

-   A set of common methods for simply specifying data validation rules

-   Repeatability of data tests (avoid unintentionally breaking your
    data set!)

-   Data-focused reporting of test results

## Installation

You can install the released version of testdat from srclib with:

``` r
# srcproj::add_srclib()
install.packages("testdat")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("socialresearchcentre/testdat")
```
